 <h3>Sick and Tired</h3>
 <p>[Verse 1]<br>
Sick, tired and homeless<br>
With no one here to sing for<br>
Tired of being weightless<br>
For all these looking good boys</p>
 <p>[Chorus]
You can always say my attic has its charm<br>
You can always say you did no major harm<br>
You can always say that summer had its charm<br>
And that you did no major harm<br>
Oh, spare me if you please</p>
 <p>[Verse 2]<br>
Sick, tired and sleepless<br>
With no one else to shine for<br>
Sick of all my distress<br>
But I won't show I'm still poor</p>
 <p>[Chorus]
You can always say my attic has its charm<br>
You can always say you did no major harm<br>
You can always say that summer had its charm<br>
And that you did no major harm<br>
Oh, spare me if you please</p>
 <p>[Chorus]
You can always say my attic has its charm<br>
You can always say you did no major harm<br>
You can always say that summer had its charm<br>
And that you did no major harm<br>
You can always say that<br>
You can always say that<br>
Oh, spare me if you please</p>
 <p>[Guitar solo]

[Outro]
Symptoms are so deep<br>
Something here's so wrong<br>
Nothing is complete<br>
Nowhere to belong<br>
Symptoms are so deep<br>
I think I'd better stay<br>
Here on my own<br>
So spare me if you please</p>
